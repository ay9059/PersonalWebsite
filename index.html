       Hello there! My name is Abhishek Yadav, a 2nd year Computer science student at <strong> Rochester Institute of Technology</strong>.
       I am originally a Nepalese who was born in Russia, moved back to Nepal for schooling and finally moved to USA to pursue my bachelor's degree (crazy, I know).
    </p>

    <p>
       I have always been fascinated by computers. Ever since I got my first desktop-pc in 2005, I spent hours on end just exploring
       the internet regarding computers. It wasn't until 2017 however, when I finally got the chance to build one for myself! 
    </p>

    <p>
       I have keen interest in programming, especially when it comes to writing scripts to automate tasks (godbless python).
       During my spare-time, when i'm not gaming, I try to familiarize myself with various programming concepts and frameworks, especially those based
       off of JavaScript. Over the years, I was able to learn programming languages such as <strong> C, Java, JavaScript & Python</strong> as well. It took me a while 
       to realize the fact that It isn't about learning new languages, instead it is more about learning data structures and algorithms. For this reason
       I have started doing 1 Leetcode problem a day.
    </p>
