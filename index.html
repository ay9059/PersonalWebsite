       Hello there! My name is Abhishek Yadav, a 2nd year Computer science student at <strong> Rochester Institute of Technology</strong>.
       I am originally a Nepalese who was born in Russia, moved back to Nepal for schooling and finally moved to USA to pursue my bachelor's degree (crazy, I know).
    </p>

    <p>
       I have always been fascinated by computers. Ever since I got my first desktop-pc in 2005, I spent hours on end just exploring
       the internet regarding computers. It wasn't until 2017 however, when I finally got the chance to build one for myself! 
    </p>

    <p>
       I have keen interest in programming, especially when it comes to writing scripts to automate tasks (godbless python).
       During my spare-time, when i'm not gaming, I try to familiarize myself with various programming concepts and frameworks, especially those based
       off of JavaScript. Over the years, I was able to learn programming languages such as <strong> C, Java, JavaScript & Python</strong> as well. It took me a while 
       to realize the fact that It isn't about learning new languages, instead it is more about learning data structures and algorithms. For this reason
       I have started doing 1 Leetcode problem a day.
    </p>

        <p>
        I enrolled to RIT during August of 2018, and ever since, I have been forced to step
        outside my comfort zone. This was a challenge at first but I soon realized the fact that
        steping outside of your comfort zone is the same as 'learning' and for this reason,
        I learned to embrace it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since the Computer Science at RIT is a 5-year program, my expected graduation date is 
            during May of 2023. And as much as I want to graduate quickly, I must say that I will miss
            it, dearly.

    <h2 class="h2">Ullens School IB, Nepal(2016-2018)</h2>

        <p>
        At Ullens School, I decided to take the IB course which was said to prepare its students for the so called
        'college life'.
         It was also during my years at Ullens when I finally made up my mind regarding what I wanted to pursue.
         I was fortunate enough to have been exposed to variety of courses at Ullens. This gave me 
         a brief Idea of what the careers in each respective field would be like.
        </p>
        <p> 
        I would often found myself 
         imagining what I would be like as an accountant, as an engineer or as a developer. Although computer science 
         wasn't a part of the curriculum during my IB diploma programme, I still took online courses on Coursera and edX just 
         to be prepared for college. And I must say, I am glad I did. 
        </p>
        
        

        <p>
           It's no secret, the IB diploma is rigorous and looking back, I must say that I am glad I put in the hardwork that was necessary.
